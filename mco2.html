		<h2>What is MCO?</h2> 

			<p>MCO is known as Movement Control Order to determine whether efforts to break the Covid-19 chain of infection are successful or not. Its effectiveness will surely depend, among others, on the people’s level of discipline to comply with the MCO, whereby the public is continuously being urged to stay at home, frequently wash their hands and adopt social distancing.</p>

		<h2>A day of My Life during MCO</h2>

			<p>There's a lots of thing we could do during the Lockdown. Since the government asked all people to stay at home, I've come up with an idea of ​​how I would spend my spare time with useful things.</p>

			<p>First thing first, I'm gonna clean up the house to ensure that it is always tidy and neat. People tend to say that I have an OCD which drag me to do all things perfectly. No slack, no mistakes! </p>
